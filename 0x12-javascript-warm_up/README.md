0x12 JavaScript - Warm up

This is project is all about JavaScript and understanding its concepts.

**What is JavaScript?**
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and versatile programming language primarily used for web development. It's an essential component of web technologies and is supported by most web browsers, making it a core technology for creating interactive and dynamic web pages.

**What is variable in javascript**
 A variable is essentially a named storage location in a computer's memory where you can store, retrieve, and manipulate data. Each variable has a unique name or identifier, which you use to refer to it in your code.

 **What are differences between var, const and let?**
 **var** is function-scoped, hoisted, and can be redeclared and reassigned.
**let** is block-scoped, hoisted, can't be redeclared, but can be reassigned.
**const** is block-scoped, hoisted, can't be redeclared, and can't be reassigned after initialization. However, for objects and arrays declared with const, their properties or elements can be modified.

**What are all the data types available in JavaScript?**
JavaScript has two main categories of data types: primitive and reference.
Primitive Data Types:
Number
